The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of Netflix Shows and their corresponding user ratings. I created various plots to illustrate the distribution of user ratings and movie ratings.

**Sample data visualization:**
